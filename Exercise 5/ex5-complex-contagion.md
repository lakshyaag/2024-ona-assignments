# Exercise 5

## What is complex contagion?

Complex contagion refers to the process by which social influence and the associated network structure can lead to the spread of behaviors, beliefs, or practices within a population. Unlike simple contagion, where a single exposure to an idea or behavior is sufficient to trigger adoption, complex contagion requires multiple exposures or reinforcement from multiple sources to influence an individual's decision-making process. In simpler terms, it means that the relative percentage of people "infected" with a certain idea matters, rather than a zero percent threshold.

## What does complex contagion mean for diffusion of behaviors in organizations?

In organizational behaviour, complex contagion is an effective tool to understand a phenomenon called "groupthink." Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome.

Complex contagion can help explain how groupthink spreads within an organization, as it requires multiple sources of influence to reinforce the group's shared beliefs or practices.

This leads to the concept of "bonds" and "bridges". Bonds are strong relationships within a group that reinforce existing beliefs or practices, while bridges are connections between different groups that can introduce new ideas or perspectives. The sweet spot for effective diffusion of behaviors in organizations is to strike a balance between bonds and bridges, to create a "small world" network that allows for the spread of ideas while maintaining diversity and adaptability.

## How can we use the threshold models to better manage policies at USPTO?

This can be acheived by identifying the critical mass of examiners needed to influence widespread adoption of positive practices. For example, introducing peer recognition programs or collaborative work initiatives between technology centers can create a forum for sharing best practices and fostering a sense of community. This could be accomplished by building a complex contagion model that identifies the key influencers within technology centers and empowering them to act as change agents.

Similarly, toxic behaviors or practices can be mitigated by identifying the tipping point at which negative practices become widespread among communities formed by examiners. By monitoring social networks and identifying early warning signs of groupthink or negative contagion, organizations can intervene proactively to prevent the spread of harmful behaviors.
